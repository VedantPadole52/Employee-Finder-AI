## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/4bca529b-1bb4-45dc-acb7-47fc00e1572a) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

üöß Why I Built This

-As someone learning to build real-world applications, I wanted to focus on understanding product design, data flow, and AI tool integration ‚Äî instead of starting purely with code. Lovable allowed me to:
-Prototype a real-world solution quickly
-Focus on logic, flow, and user experience
-Learn how AI tools can assist development
-Understand how to structure apps without needing to manually code every part

üß† What I Learned

-How no-code AI tools work in practice
-Basics of app logic and workflow automation
-Importance of UI/UX in functional web apps
-How to communicate between front-end features and backend data (even if assisted)

üí° Future Plans

-Rebuild parts of the app manually (e.g. using React or Next.js)
-Add database integration (e.g. Firebase, MongoDB)
-Add authentication and user roles
-Improve matching algorithm manually

üìå Disclaimer

This project was built with the help of the Lovable AI platform. Some parts of the logic and UI were generated or assisted by the platform. I focused on understanding the app's structure, features, and the role of AI in accelerating development. This project is part of my learning journey in tech and software development.
